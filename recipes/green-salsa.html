    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 tomatillos</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Serrano Pepper or Jalapeno Pepper</li>
        <li>Cilantro (6 to 8 sprigs)</li>
        <li>1/2 white onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    

    <ol>
        <li>Spread the tomatillos, unpeeled garlic, and chiles on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast the ingredients under a broiler, about 4 inches below the heat source.
          <ul>
            <li>Roast until the tomatillos and chiles are blotchy brown on one side, approximately 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip everything over and roast the other side.</li>
            <li>The garlic should feel soft.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Allow the roasted ingredients to cool until handleable.</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic cloves and scrape everything, including any juices, into a blender or food processor.</li>
        <li>Pulse the ingredients in the blender or food processor until you achieve the desired consistency (smooth but with some texture).</li>
        <li>Gather the cilantro into a tight bundle and thinly slice across it, including leaves and stems, until you run out of leaves.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion into approximately Â¼-inch pieces.
          <ul>
            <li>Rinse the chopped onion in a strainer under cold water to remove the strong flavor.</li>
            <li>Shake off excess water and add the onion to the salsa.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the sliced cilantro to the salsa.</li>
        <li>If the salsa is too thick, stir in water a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste the salsa and season with salt, typically around a scant teaspoon.
          <ul>
            <li>Note: Adjusting other ingredients may be difficult due to the roasted nature of the salsa, except for cilantro and onion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
    
    </ol>
